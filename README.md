# auto-ssh
tool for automating our ssh process.
Our products are on moving vehicles so they go in and out of wifi coverage.
We would have to wait around until one came into coverage to ssh onto it and do what we need to do.
This tool automates that process by waiting till there is a connection then sshing onto and running commands
that are prewritten in a text document.
we also added the abilty to put files onto the machines.
